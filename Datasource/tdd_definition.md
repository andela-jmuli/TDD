###Test Driven Development  
Test-driven development also called test-driven design, is a method of software development in which unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. According to [TechTarget](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/test-driven-development), 'The concept is to get something working now and perfect it later.'  
The result of using this practice is a comprehensive suite of unit tests that can be run at any time to provide feedback that the software is still working.  
One of the promary goals of TDD is specification and not just validation. In other words, it's a way of thinking about your requirements or design before you write your code. This is one of the pillars of agile development specifically during FDD(feature driven development).  

#### Best Practices:  
1. Tests should be logically as simple as possible  
2. Each unit test should be independent of all other tests.
3. Each test should be clearly named and documented.  
4. Strive for one assertion per test case.  
5. Create tests that cover exceptions.  

#### Some pros' of Unit testing:  
1. Helps with early detection of bugs and problems.  
2. Can prove to be a good documentation source.  
3. Simplifies integration via testing smaller components then testing them together, integration testing becomes much easier.
